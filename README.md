It’s the report card season once again and we can’t deny that the amount of time and energy that goes into recording and evaluating students is just too much!

Usually grading week is one of the most demanding times of the year. Teachers must calculate grades accurately in addition to leaving personal comments. Computing grades is generally a piece of cake, but the comments can take you a lifetime!

Teachers have to consider what kind of comments, and how should they word these comments! The comments should help students and parents understand how they can improve upon their past work. It’s important that personal comments are not belittling the student, but instead addressing any concerns along with encouragement.
